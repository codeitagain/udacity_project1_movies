Udacity - Project 1 - Create a "Movie Trailer Website"

This Python application creates an HTML document and opens it in a Web browser.  The HTML document displays a list of favorite movies, including each movie's title, poster, and trailer.

The whole application consists of 3 files, including entertainment_center.py, media.py, and fresh_tomatoes.py.  The application is run by executing <b>entertainment_center.py</b> which also contains all the data for the movies, except for the storyline information which is retrieved from the API at TheMovieDb.org.  The <b>media.py</b> file defines the classes used in the application.  And <b>fresh_tomatoes.py</b> creates the HTML document and opens it in a Web browser.  All 3 of these files must reside in the same directory.

To execute this application you must first install the Python application.  <b>In Python, just Run entertainment_center.py.</b>  Alternatively, you can create an executable file using py2exe (for windows) or PyInstaller (for windows and Linux) or Py2app (for Mac).
