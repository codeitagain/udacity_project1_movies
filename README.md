Udacity - Project 1 - Create a "Movie Trailer Website"

This Python application creates an HTML document and opens it in a Web browser.  The HTML document displays a list of favorite movies, including each movie's title, poster, and trailer.

The whole application consists of 3 files, including entertainment_center.py, media.py, and fresh_tomatoes.py.  The application is run by executing entertainment_center.py which also contains all the data for the movies used in this application.  The media.py file defines the classes used in the application.  And fresh_tomatoes.py creates the HTML document and opens it in a Web browser.  All 3 of these files must reside in the same directory.
